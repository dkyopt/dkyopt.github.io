I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University (West Lafayette), where I work with Prof. [Gesualdo Scutari](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~gscutari/). Prior to this, in 2024, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the National University of Singapore (NUS), working with Prof. [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from NUS in December 2023 under the supervision of Prof. [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). I obtained my B.S. from Department of Mathemticas at Nanjing University in 2019.



Research Interests
======
- Stochastic Optimization
- Distributed Optimization

My research focuses on the development, analysis, and implementation of stochastic and distributed optimization algorithms for problems in machine learning, deep learning, operations research, and engineering, aiming to bridge theoretical advances with practical solutions. In stochastic optimization, I study continuous-time perspectives (ODEs/SDEs) to analyze and design modern optimization algorithms. In distributed optimization, I am interested in efficient methods beyond standard consensus protocols. I am also interested in optimization in non-Euclidean geometries.
